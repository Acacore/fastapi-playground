# fastapi-playground
FastAPI Learning Project

This project is a hands-on learning journey into FastAPI.

It begins with simple GET endpoints and will progressively evolve to include:

Request and response validation

Path and query parameters

Pydantic models

Database integration

Authentication & authorization

Async operations

Deployment strategies

The goal of this repository is to deeply understand FastAPI’s architecture, performance advantages, and best practices for building modern APIs.
